# RugbyCoachKit Swift Files

Drop these into a new **App** project in Xcode (SwiftUI / Swift). On first launch, open the **Settings** tab and paste your hosted Streamlit URL (e.g. https://example.streamlit.app).

Tabs automatically append `?view=dashboard|availability|teamsheet|pitch` so your Streamlit app can show the right section.

Built for iOS 15+ on iPhone and iPad.
